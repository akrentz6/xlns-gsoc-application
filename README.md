# XLNS GSoC Application 2025

See the challenges folder for my implementations for each coding challenge from Section 3. I have implementations in PyTorch and Tensorflow for each.

See the demos folder to find full working scripts for the code snippets found in Section 4 (Project Goals) of my application. These build upon each other so that in general, more functionality is added with each script. It might be helpful to follow along with these scripts whilst reading the application (although the later scripts get quite large).
